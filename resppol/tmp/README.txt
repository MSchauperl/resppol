The phenol and butanol data is copied from /home/mis/kirk/charge_method/medium_set.
It corresponds to molecule 1 and 2. 

This data will be used to test the new functionality we are implementing and the compatibility with g09/resp results

For the testpurpose we will use smaller files created with respyte. 
How these files are created should be are part of a notebook I have to include.
